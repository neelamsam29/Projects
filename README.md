EXPLORING PREDICTIVE TECHNIQUES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION

The research titled "Exploring Predictive Techniques for Agricultural Production"
aims at discovering a predictive model for agricultural yield in India through
making an investigation into the methodologies adopted for machine learning on
the historical dataset within the span of 28 years. The dataset comprises all the
variables, state designation, variety, precipitation level, temperature, use of
fertilizer, pH, and metric yield of crops. These features will make the project
determine crop yields in tons as well as decide for the good of agricultural
stakeholders.
A number of machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, CatBoost,
Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, and many more were applied and
tested to check the efficacy of crop yield prediction. Using considerable data sets,
important preprocessing steps including missing values and normalizing features
have been undergone.I used both Voting Regressor and Stacking Regressor and, in
both cases, it improved the prediction accuracy. For the model themselves, the
performance metric in each case will be the RÂ² score. The results obtained clearly
show that ensemble models created with an approach of combining individual
models, especially Random Forest and CatBoost, decisively outperform single
regression models and are, thus, can be treated as a good technique in yield
forecasting. The model constructed can be a useful tool for policymakers, farmers,
and other interested persons to understand and interpret trends and enable datadriven decisions for improved productivity in agriculture across the different parts
of India.
Another of the greatest determinants of precision agriculture is the affinity of
machine learning methods to data, specifically domain-specific. That way, the
accurate crop yield forecast is possible.
